Projecto2

epicodus project, working with github for a few weeks now, getting very familiar with it.

{Projecto2}

_{This is an example website with three links to adult services for vacation (although we advertise it as a family friendly, we want to make aware the customer, that the activities might implicate some dangerous activities) I worked on this project, and tried to finalize it by {02/26/19} 

{For this 8th week project I worked on it my self, without a pair as a solo project is required}

This project is a small website dedicated to sell fun packages to adults, the site requires you to enter youir age at the begining of the page. 
_{this application/webpage contains three links to three different packages of entertainment, I have worked on this as a student at epicodus.}

Setup/Installation Requirements.

_Scroll down to the mid area of the page.
_There are three links with to videos of the activities we offer.
_First link will take you to the cenote package we offer.
_Second link will take you to a snorkeling short video of the second package we offer.
_Third link will take you to the motorcycle package. All of the packages are meant for adults, which is the reason the webpage enquires your age in the begining.

_{The site is simple on this stage of development. Not known bugs have surfaced, other than running java.script and jquery, no bugs have surface yet with this two programs I applied}
